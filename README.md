# Finance
Finance is a fake stock exchange built on React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. It was a project aimed toward developing an app with more client/server interaction than Universal-Chuck. Additionally, Finance uses JSON web tokens for authentication, and Redux as a central store for authentication and responsiveness. Other concepts explored include async/await and higher order functions.
